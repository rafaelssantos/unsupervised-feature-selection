# unsupervised-feature-selection
An unsupervised feature selection approach.
This repository implements a feature selection approach that produces a dissimilarity ranking. The technique is based on the technique proposed by [Mitra, P., Murthy, C.A. and Pal, S.K. (2002)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/990133).

## Feature similarity measures
- Maximal information compression index;
- Least squares regression error;
- Pearson correlation coefficient.

## Requirements
- CMake 3.5 or later;
- C++17 or later.
